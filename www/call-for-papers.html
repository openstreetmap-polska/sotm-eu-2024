Please ensure that your participants shouldn’t be told to create an account at a business platform or a platform with user tracking. Or, if so, communicate that clearly in your submission and provide guest accounts for your participants.</p>

    <h3>Other session types</h3>
    <p class="text">We plan to provide space for other session types which cannot be submitted in advance. Details will be announced before the conference.</p>
    <h4 class="subtitle">Birds of a Feather</h4>
    <p class="text">Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions are informal, spontaneous discussion rounds centered around a specific topic. It is not possible to submit a BoF session in advance. BoFs are about to be organized during the conference according to the needs of participants.</p>
    <h4 class="subtitle">Free Space for discussion</h4>
    <p class="text">The organizer in certain cases may provide free discussion space for working groups, OSM local branches and local communities</p>

    <h3>Rating Criteria</h3>
    <p class="text">In rating submissions, we are going to apply the following criteria:</p>
    <ul role="list">
      <li>OSM as the subject: A submission where OSM is the main subject or an important ingredient is rated higher than one that is more generic (e.g. a general talk about GIS software).</li>
      <li>Preference of “open”: A submission about open data and open source software is preferred over the one that deals with proprietary data or proprietary software and closed platforms.</li>
      <li>Preference of innovation: A submission about something new, or something not discussed at previous conferences, is preferred over one that discusses more widely known issues (exception: OSM Basics).</li>
      <li>We are hoping for talks from a multitude of speakers and hence we would prefer accepting a talk from a “new” speaker over accepting a second talk from someone who has already an accepted talk.</li>
      <li>We may also try to avoid accepting too many talks from members of the same organisation.</li>
      <li>We prefer talks from members of underrepresented groups.</li>
      <li>We value transparency. We prefer submissions that disclose affiliations and sponsors of their work.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text">In rating submissions, we are going to apply the following criteria:</p>
    <ul role="list">
      <li>We might ask if several speakers can merge their talks.</li>
      <li>We might also ask if a change of format would be possible (for example we might suggest the lightning talk format instead of a regular oral presentation when we find there is not enough content for a complete talk, but an interesting subject).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="section">
    <h3>Language</h3>
    <p class="text">The conference language of State of the Map Europe is English. All presentations shall be held in English. It is an important aspect of the conference that participants can interact with the speakers for questions and discussions. Non-English speaking participants are welcome to meet in the Birds of a Feather sessions.</p>

    <h3>Fees</h3>
    <p class="text">State of the Map Europe is a non-commercial event where neither organizers nor speakers are paid. Contributors do not have any special privileges when it comes to conference fees, however the organizing committee reserves the right to waive this requirement for key speakers.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="section">
    <h3>Programme Committee</h3>
    <p class="text">Your submissions will be reviewed by the Programme Committee consisting of OpenStreetMap community members from various parts of the world. The Programme Committee is aware of possible conflict of interest situations. We try to balance that in the composition of the committee. Nevertheless, we have imposed some rules upon ourselves to handle conflict of interest situations:</p>
    <ul role="list">
      <li>We do not rate submissions from our workmates, clients or relatives.</li>
      <li>We act carefully and are aware about possible conflicts (especially the situation of horse trading). We act particularly carefully in cases associated to a sponsor.</li>
      <li>We communicate to other Programme Committee members when we are in a conflict of interest situation.</li>
      <li>We report any outside attempt of influencing their decisions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text">We hope this detailed “Call for participation” helps to increase the transparency of our programme selection process. Questions are welcome. You can reach us at the following email address: <a href="#" class="link">cfp@openstreetmap.pl</a>.</p>
